Briefly, the code in the repo is taken from mine expirience and aims to help the automation community.

It includes different automation projects such as:
- C# DB BDD SpecFlow automation
- Groovy BDD Cucumber browser automation
- Gatling configs for Grafana/Graphite
- REST API automation best practises

Take care and have a good day !
